# Project: Used Car Price Prediction
This repository contains a project focused on predicting the selling price of used cars. The aim is to build an algorithm that effectively determines the worthiness of a car by considering various factors. The dataset used is a CSV file obtained from Kaggle, called 'Car details v3.csv'.

### Part 1: Introduction
This section provides an overview of the used car market and its trends, highlighting the impact of Covid-19. It also explains the value of accurate price prediction systems and identifies the target audience for this analysis.

### Part 2: Data Understanding
Here, the dataset is explored to understand its structure and the relationships between different attributes. Data visualizations using R and Tableau are employed to analyze attribute distributions, correlations, and trends.

### Part 3: Data Preparation
The dataset is preprocessed to ensure it is in a structured format suitable for modeling. This includes converting variables to numeric, handling missing values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Part 4: Model Building and Evaluation
Multiple regression models are built to predict the selling price of used cars. Different base models, including linear regression, regression tree, random forest, and XGBoost, are trained and evaluated. Model performance is measured using the root mean squared error (RMSE).

### Part 5: Recommendations
Based on the analysis and model results, recommendations are provided for decision-makers in the used car market. Key variables to consider, such as the year and maximum power of the car, are highlighted for effective price estimation.

*Note:* The repository includes code, analysis, and the dataset used in the project.
